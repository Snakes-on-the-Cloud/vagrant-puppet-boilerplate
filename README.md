# vagrant-puppet-boilerplate

A simple Vagrant boilerplate setup (configured using the [PuPHPet](https://puphpet.com/) GUI).

## Prerequisites

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Usage

### Project directory structure

This config assumes your projects have a directory structure that looks something like this:

```
myproject/
myproject/site/
myproject/shared/
```

We track our projects one directory up from the site's webroot, which is usually `myproject/site/public_html/`. Therefore, you should clone your main project repo into the `myproject/site/` folder.

All assets you don't want tracked by git (such as environment config files, cache folders, media upload folders etc.) should be symlinked from their default locations in `myproject/site/public_html/` into `myproject/shared/`.

**Important: Don't yet run anything such as `composer install`, `npm install`, `bower install` etc. on your project. You should only do this once your Vagrant box is up-and-running and you are logged in to the ssh shell.**

### Adding Vagrant

Essentially you have two options:

1. [Download this repo](https://github.com/gpmd/vagrant-puppet-boilerplate/archive/master.zip), and put all the contents (except `README.md`) into the `myproject/site/` directory.
2. Take just the [config.yaml](https://github.com/gpmd/vagrant-puppet-boilerplate/blob/master/puphpet/config.yaml) file from this repo and drop it onto the [puphpet.com](https://puphpet.com/) webpage, enabling you to modify all the settings at will and create your own manifest.

Whether you choose to download this repo or just use the `config.yaml` file with [puphpet.com](https://puphpet.com/), you will need to change all instances of **'myproject'** in `config.yaml` to the actual name of your project.

You should also make sure the paths in `config.yaml`, specifically the `synced_folder` and `vhosts` settings, reflect your own environment - again, we are assuming your webroot is `myproject/site/public_html/`, but if it's not you'll need to find the relevant section in `config.yaml` and change it.

Either way, it's worth familiarising yourself with [puphpet.com](https://puphpet.com/) to see what options are available to you.

### Adding your own dotfiles and shell scripts

* Put your own dotfiles in `myproject/site/puphpet/files/dot`.
* Put your own shell scripts in `myproject/site/puphpet/files/exec-always` or `myproject/site/puphpet/files/exec-once`.

**Node, Grunt, Bower and Compass**

If you choose to use this repo as-is, we have [already added a shell script](https://github.com/gpmd/vagrant-puppet-boilerplate/blob/master/puphpet/files/exec-once/frontend-tools.sh) to `myproject/site/puphpet/files/exec-once` that installs Node, Grunt-cli, Bower and Compass.

You can find out more about this on the [Server section of the PuPHPet website](https://puphpet.com/#server).

### Modifying your hosts file

On a Mac (and Linux I believe) the `hosts` files can be found in `/etc/hosts`. Simply add a new entry to the end of this file:

`192.168.56.101 myproject.dev`

## Using Vagrant

**Note: all `vagrant` commands should be run from your `myproject/site/` directory (and not from 'inside' the virtual machine)**

In order to set up your virtual machine for the first time (fair warning - this could take quite a while), or to restart it if you've halted it you need to run:

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

Once the machine has started up and installed all its dependencies you can log in to the machine using:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```

**You can now do all your command line work on your project from within the Vagrant box ssh shell.**

You can put the machine to sleep by running:

```bash
$ vagrant halt
```

You can also just exit the machine (leaving it running in the background):

**Note: This command you would run from 'inside' the virtual machine.**

```bash
$ exit
```

If, after having already set up the machine, you add additional shell scripts to `myproject/site/puphpet/files/exec-always` you can provision these by running:

```bash
$ vagrant provision
```

You can get rid of the machine by running:

```bash
$ vagrant destroy
```

## Issues

### Apache user and group permissions

We found that we ran into a problem whereby Apache couldn't write to any files or folders. In order to 'fix' this we made a change to `myproject/site/Vagrantfile`. [This blog post](http://www.robertprice.co.uk/robblog/2013/06/allowing-apache-to-write-to-vagrant/) has more information on the problem if you're interested.

We changed this line:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "#{folder['source']}", "#{folder['target']}", id: "#{folder['id']}", type: nfs
```

To this:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "#{folder['source']}", "#{folder['target']}", id: "#{folder['id']}", type: nfs, :owner => "www-data", :group => "www-data"
```

This makes sure that Apache has permissions to write to files and folders in the VM synced directory.

**Note: This is not an ideal solution â€“ don't do this on a live environment, but it's fine for development environments.**
